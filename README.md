Given the first order differential equation descibing the velocity of some vehicle on a flat surface:

$$m\dot{v}+cv=F$$

Where $v$ is the velocity of the vehicle, $m$ the mass, $c$ the momentum loss due to air resistance or surface friction, and $F$ the force generated by the engine. The simplified control system is given by the equation:

$$\dot{v}+cv=u$$

Being $u$ the control signal. The default value of $c$ is 0.05.
