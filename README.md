# Cruise Control

Given the first order differential equation descibing the velocity of some vehicle on a flat surface:

$$m\dot{v}+cv=F$$

Where $v$ is the velocity of the vehicle, $m$ the mass, $c$ the momentum loss due to air resistance or surface friction, and $F$ the force generated by the engine. The simplified control system, where the control is given by $u$, is given by the equation:

$$\dot{v}+cv=u$$

The default value of $c$ is 0.02. Being $v_0$ the target velocity (8 by default), the reward function if given by:

$$r(v) = -\||u\||^2_2 + \begin{cases}100 & v=v_0 \\
-100 & v \neq v_0
\end{cases}$$

The system is simulated using Euler's method with timestep of 0.001 by default. Each episode is 100 timesteps. The observation and action space are $\mathbb{R}$.

# Mass-Spring-Damper Model

The homogeneous equation for the mass-spring-damper model is given by:

$$\ddot{x} +\frac{c}{m} \dot{x} + \frac{k}{m} x =0$$

Where $m$ is the mass, $c$ the dampening coeficient and $k$ the spring frequency. Now, simplifying the model by assuming $m=1$, and adding an external force as the control $(u)$, we get the equation:

$$\ddot{x} +c \dot{x} + k x =u$$
